Seminar 6, led by Dr. Godfried Williams, focused on building database management systems (DBMS) and understanding their role in real-world applications. The discussion built on the earlier “Dream Home” property management case study, where a company needed a system to manage property listings and client rentals. This example illustrated how databases support data storage, manipulation, and accessibility for both local and remote users.

Focus: Design and implementation of relational database systems.

Key Points:

Builds on the Dream Home case by linking data modeling to real applications.

Overview of relational database management systems: MySQL, SQL Server, SQLite.

Discussion of data storage, manipulation, and global accessibility.

Importance of maintaining data integrity and supporting multi-user environments.

Learning Outcomes:

Understand DBMS architecture and principles.

Use relational models to organize and query structured data.

Apply SQL for database creation, manipulation, and retrieval.

Recognize scalability and accessibility challenges in distributed databases.
