1
00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.630
Godfried Williams: Hello, everyone, and good evening. Thank you for…

2
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.270
Godfried Williams: Coming this evening, this seminar.

3
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:18.860
Godfried Williams: It's on data investigations and case studies acquiring and storing, data.

4
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.100
Godfried Williams: So, there's an assignment, which is, do you…

5
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.540
Godfried Williams: on the 8th of September, and that is… team…

6
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:38.480
Godfried Williams: work as a project work. Are there two parts, which is the group work, and then there's an individual submission

7
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:39.930
Godfried Williams: As well.

8
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.010
Godfried Williams: Right, so the general… learning outcomes…

9
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:55.610
Godfried Williams: Mainly to understand the challenges. There's a risk and limitations associated with…

10
00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:03.169
Godfried Williams: data wrangling, and the concept of wrangling is how we manipulate data or handle

11
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:09.830
Godfried Williams: Big data, you know, and the complexities that are, intrinsic or inherent

12
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:19.080
Godfried Williams: with, data, especially when the data becomes large, so we want to try to understand the challenges

13
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:28.530
Godfried Williams: The security issues and limitations associated with the data, but as well as the opportunities that come with

14
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:38.190
Godfried Williams: Wrongling the data, or manipulating the data. And also, critically, analyze… the… data.

15
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:48.319
Godfried Williams: And understand the problems and determine appropriate methodologies and tools that can be used in, addressing

16
00:01:48.750 --> 00:02:03.009
Godfried Williams: Some of the challenges in terms of the noise that comes with the data, to be able to clean the data, explore the data, and optimize the value of the data within the business context.

17
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:19.659
Godfried Williams: Or within an organization, and also be able to design and develop, evaluate appropriate solutions using the data sets that might be available to your organization or your business, and be able to deploy

18
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:27.710
Godfried Williams: That, or any system, effectively, by applying some of the data modeling concepts.

19
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.430
Godfried Williams: So, when it comes to data investigation.

20
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:42.369
Godfried Williams: The idea is that we want to determine the source, or the sources of data.

21
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:50.069
Godfried Williams: And establish the credibility or the integrity of the data, because, if we're to go back to…

22
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.599
Godfried Williams: Perhaps, refresh our memory.

23
00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:05.749
Godfried Williams: With respect to the characteristics of large data, We could, remember… Things like… features such as…

24
00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:20.230
Godfried Williams: the veracity of the data, which I'll do the quality of the data, the velocity, that's the four Vs, and the variety as well. You know, but the veracity here is very important in the sense that

25
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:30.260
Godfried Williams: the emphasis of veracity of data has to do with the quality of the data, that's the integrity of the data. So, when you are carrying out any data investigations.

26
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.230
Godfried Williams: You want to focus on credibility of sources, of the data.

27
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.790
Godfried Williams: And…

28
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:48.299
Godfried Williams: Credibility on the sources will help you to do some fact-checking, making the sources verifiable, doing your cross-reference, and…

29
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.860
Godfried Williams: and also being able to contact original source. So, we've listed some.

30
00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:05.970
Godfried Williams: Credible sources when you're carrying out data investigations, and these comprise, like, government, international agencies, research institutions,

31
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:17.339
Godfried Williams: And, you know, like, the WHO reports, you know, which are meant to be independent, reporting and reflect some real facts, you know.

32
00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.730
Godfried Williams: And also, when we have extracted these sources.

33
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.619
Godfried Williams: We want to be able to present the data in a manner which is readable.

34
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:40.359
Godfried Williams: Regardless of the format in which we extracted the data, because data may be extracted in different formats, depending on where they are kept or where they are stored.

35
00:04:40.470 --> 00:05:00.040
Godfried Williams: And as a result, we should have tools or data management, or data storing formats, that allows us to be able to store the data regardless of the way we have extracted the data from these different sources. So, readability is key.

36
00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:16.629
Godfried Williams: that's why we have an extended markup language, you know, you have also the JavaScript objectnotation, you have common separate values, CSV, and you have SQL for relational, data baseline assistance. So, these sort of data formatting

37
00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.780
Godfried Williams: should I say, models, allows us to be able to

38
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:38.800
Godfried Williams: present the data in different ways, but also allows us to store the data in a variety of formats, regardless of how we extract it, how we extracted these data. So the cleanliness

39
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:48.099
Godfried Williams: As well, an important aspect of acquiring and storing the data. You know, when we extract any data, there should be data claims sent.

40
00:05:48.410 --> 00:06:04.519
Godfried Williams: Through the data pipeline, where data is clean, because you may have duplications, you may have redundancies, there could be human errors, you can also have after lies, and, …

41
00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.509
Godfried Williams: you know, Aspect of the data, which…

42
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:27.160
Godfried Williams: creates unnatural ambiguity, and because it creates unnatural ambiguity, you want to be able to clean the data and have a more refined, should I say, output that can be used more effectively. Then, of course, the longevity, how long can we

43
00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:33.339
Godfried Williams: Keep data, and that is something that has to do more with, …

44
00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:46.630
Godfried Williams: regulation, you know, so when it comes to how long we can… we can store the data, that has to do with regulation, so we can relate that to GDPR. When it comes to that, different…

45
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:53.080
Godfried Williams: countries in Europe and other parts of the world may, have different…

46
00:06:53.290 --> 00:07:00.000
Godfried Williams: regulatory requirements for storing the data, but in particular reference to GDPR,

47
00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:16.829
Godfried Williams: you may store the data as long as it is relevant. You know, in some areas, for instance, the financial data might take between 6 to 7 years, and you may… you could sort of release that sort of data, you know, when… especially when

48
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:27.970
Godfried Williams: financial reporting has been done comprehensively. When it comes to medical data, for instance, that might take longer, and in… in some aspects,

49
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:34.289
Godfried Williams: Depending on the organization, and for the purposes which the data is stored, it might be

50
00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:50.239
Godfried Williams: practically almost indefinite, because you might need the data for future references, or maybe for security purposes, and therefore, the data may take long. So, here are some of the sources of the data, …

51
00:07:50.400 --> 00:08:09.160
Godfried Williams: how data can be captured, in terms of the, veracity, the quality of the data. We've mentioned all the NGOs with government agencies, scientific data, international organizations, all serve as credible sources of,

52
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:20.429
Godfried Williams: extracting the data. So, if I may ask, Sonia, for example, you don't necessarily have to disclose that, you know, in detail, but in your organization, where are some of…

53
00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:32.000
Godfried Williams: How do you verify the veracity, the quality of data that you obtain from different sources? How do you know that the data you're processing

54
00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:33.419
Godfried Williams: is, ….

55
00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:50.299
Sonya Jackson: Yeah, I mean, it's a good question. We obviously have internal data from scientific studies, but we also tap into a lot of, open source science data as well, and you have to understand how that data was collected, where it was collected from.

56
00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:56.189
Sonya Jackson: How it's been formatted, how it's been transformed, potentially, because this can affect

57
00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:10.309
Sonya Jackson: your sort of analysis that you do with it, and what you get from your readouts. So I think it's really important to understand, especially when you're using secondary data, what's happened to that data previously, and I think that's something that we

58
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.989
Sonya Jackson: Sort of make sure it's done thoroughly to understand.

59
00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:22.130
Godfried Williams: Right, thank you for that. So, have there been any instance where… …

60
00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:34.359
Godfried Williams: you questioned, not necessarily you, but I'm referring to the organization, questioned the… the integrity of a certain data set.

61
00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:39.879
Godfried Williams: And I said, I said, are you aware of any instance like that? Or it's not something that.

62
00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:40.470
Sonya Jackson: Hmm.

63
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:42.510
Godfried Williams: You're, ….

64
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:50.280
Sonya Jackson: I mean, nothing specifically, but there have been cases where we've reached out to, like, primary authors to

65
00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:57.489
Sonya Jackson: Ask them very direct kind of questions related to the data that they're presenting, or that they've published, or that we can access.

66
00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:00.170
Godfried Williams: Right. So, we've definitely had examples of that.

67
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:00.630
Sonya Jackson: Yeah.

68
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:02.879
Godfried Williams: Okay, so you needed more, sort of.

69
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.810
Sonya Jackson: More information.

70
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:05.409
Godfried Williams: on that, okay.

71
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:06.600
Sonya Jackson: Exactly, yeah.

72
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.970
Godfried Williams: Right, okay. So, based on what I mentioned,

73
00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:18.880
Godfried Williams: They are, of course, investigative methods that are used to extract data

74
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:25.849
Godfried Williams: From a variety of sources, checking all the facts, that I extracted from these sources.

75
00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:30.239
Godfried Williams: Can be critical in respect of the quality

76
00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:35.900
Godfried Williams: Process that is used, and this, usually involves verification.

77
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:40.769
Godfried Williams: Ensuring the sources can be trusted, validation, which is ensuring the data

78
00:10:40.870 --> 00:11:00.010
Godfried Williams: it's what it meant to be, because there's one thing, the data could be misleading. I've heard all kinds of comments from statisticians, you know, and that's a very… very interesting one, that, you know, another statistician will say that, well, depends on what you're looking for, you know, you can…

79
00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:12.950
Godfried Williams: actually analyze the data in a certain way to arrive at a certain conclusion, you know. There's some element of perhaps truth in that, but of course, you cannot

80
00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:13.910
Godfried Williams: …

81
00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:33.639
Godfried Williams: should I say, cheat the data? The data is what it is. Even though they are figures, it is what they are. You know, so it's subject to interpretation. I guess that it has to do with the interpretation of data, or perhaps the sources. I mean, if you use certain secondary sources.

82
00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:40.799
Godfried Williams: then you may need to go one step further to verify these secondary sources, and if you did use

83
00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:46.820
Godfried Williams: primary sources as part of research, then there's also the need to

84
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.319
Godfried Williams: Validate your primary sources in terms of…

85
00:11:51.350 --> 00:12:04.010
Godfried Williams: Whether the sources you obtained the data from were coming from experts or were coming from, depends on the purpose of the investigation, they will come from ordinary citizens.

86
00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:12.709
Godfried Williams: In communities as well, you know? So, I guess it depends on what the research is for, what the data is going to be used for.

87
00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:18.620
Godfried Williams: That is… that is what will serve as the benchmark for evaluating or validating

88
00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:35.619
Godfried Williams: the credibility or the integrity of the data. So, there are a number of key points here, which I've sort of highlighted. Of course, you ask certain questions whether the data source is verifiable, should be able to carry out validation.

89
00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:49.140
Godfried Williams: To eliminate redundancies, you should be able also to look at the frequency of the data, update an error check, you know, because you may have… you could be reporting about, …

90
00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:53.909
Godfried Williams: In medical research, you could be reporting about a certain type of

91
00:12:54.100 --> 00:13:08.060
Godfried Williams: Maybe you'll be in a better position to give an example, but there's a type of… of… of condition, you know, condition, right? And… and the characteristics of the condition

92
00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:13.450
Godfried Williams: Could be subject to change depending on other external factors as well.

93
00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:25.770
Godfried Williams: You know, whether they are influenced by economics, or they're influenced by environmental changes, they're influenced by government policy.

94
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:29.320
Godfried Williams: May… they may all influence the way

95
00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:38.359
Godfried Williams: the data is captured, or the data reflects in specific instances, right? So…

96
00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:43.740
Godfried Williams: I mean, how would you describe that kind of scenario, where…

97
00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:55.999
Godfried Williams: You look at the frequency of data updates, you know, why data updates is important within medical research, or something to do with the health sector, and as a result, if

98
00:13:56.090 --> 00:14:03.920
Godfried Williams: the… the data is obsolete, or it's sort of outdated, then we can… one can suggest that

99
00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:15.010
Godfried Williams: that data is not really credible, or the quality has been compromised. I mean, how would you… what sort of scenario can you relate to?

100
00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:33.449
Sonya Jackson: I mean, yeah, I've had examples of this in clinical trials, especially when you mention government policy and funding and things, because you find that the data is collected in different ways in different countries.

101
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:40.049
Sonya Jackson: And that can be very important, because certain drugs can be funded and others aren't, so you have inaccurate data.

102
00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:46.229
Sonya Jackson: For a medicine that's given that's actually aligned to a different condition than the patient actually has, because

103
00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:50.770
Sonya Jackson: In that country, they get funding for a certain condition and not for something else.

104
00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:51.570
Godfried Williams: Right, okay.

105
00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:54.149
Sonya Jackson: Yeah, it's just an example, ….

106
00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:54.800
Godfried Williams: Right.

107
00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.590
Godfried Williams: Right, so the data could be misleading.

108
00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:05.480
Sonya Jackson: Yeah, it's misleading. You have to go back to the source and kind of question the source to understand it very clearly.

109
00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:12.279
Godfried Williams: Sure. All right, thanks. So, so this is a very important process. Of course, the data should be

110
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:25.820
Godfried Williams: Readable, cleanliness is important, longevity is something I mentioned, so readability, updates, errors are misreported, you can have methods that can be questioned.

111
00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:45.599
Godfried Williams: You have how clean is your data. As we mentioned, there could be all sort of reasons or factors that could impact on the cleanliness of the data, and then the longevity of the data as well. You know, the point is, if data is stored at different places.

112
00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:58.420
Godfried Williams: and they port it from other sources, no, other storage to different storage places. The question is, do they get affected or not? You know, and that's something that

113
00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:09.519
Godfried Williams: One up to evaluate as well, because you want to, to be confident about the wholeness, the integrity of the data, because you may be using the data for other

114
00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.849
Godfried Williams: Purposes such as formulating policy.

115
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:27.169
Godfried Williams: And… or it can inform your strategy, your planning, and therefore, you need to go further to, you know, carry out some kind of not just verification, but also validation, and an evaluation of

116
00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:32.070
Godfried Williams: The, the data that has been stored at different places.

117
00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:35.750
Godfried Williams: Any questions up to that point? Please, any questions?

118
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:38.689
Godfried Williams: No question, right, okay.

119
00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:49.680
Godfried Williams: So, I mean, data storage is very important, because as I mentioned, Data storage can impact

120
00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:56.300
Godfried Williams: or influence the quality of the data. That's the veracity of the data.

121
00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:14.870
Godfried Williams: And also, that can lead to all kinds of challenges or problems. So you can look at it from a security point of view. If you look at it in a security contest, or even in a safety contest, you know, whether within medical research or aviation.

122
00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:29.510
Godfried Williams: or you look at the banking sector, you look at finance, you realize that where data is stored is very important, and how data is stored as well. So where is stored, how data is stored?

123
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:40.600
Godfried Williams: If the data is not actually stored properly, you may lose some part of the data when the data is being transported. So, here we look at cloud.

124
00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:41.700
Godfried Williams: Oz…

125
00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:52.859
Godfried Williams: a concept… I'll use the… I mean, the term cloud is more… more of a marketing jargon, rather than something meant to be…

126
00:17:52.970 --> 00:18:07.010
Godfried Williams: what it actually means, in terms of what it does. You know, clouds are just distributed databases that are deployed remotely. So, in the past, you may have databases that were

127
00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:26.679
Godfried Williams: deployed remotely, and this could be relational databases, you could… it could be just flat files, and you may be able to connect to those files remotely based on what sort of program that you're using. So, that sort of concept, sort of developed into

128
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:44.700
Godfried Williams: wider, should I say, wider application where the remote database is not just accessible by individual businesses or organizations. So the idea of distributed databases were just restricted to

129
00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:53.839
Godfried Williams: The individual businesses, organizations, where, you know, whether employees or customers, other stakeholders.

130
00:18:53.990 --> 00:19:03.559
Godfried Williams: That passed through the business or the organization's security credentials were able to access the data remotely.

131
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:15.069
Godfried Williams: So that is how, you know, the whole concept of cloud developed. Developed from distributed databases. Now, but then when you look at cloud, we look at it beyond distributed databases in terms of

132
00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:28.320
Godfried Williams: remote access globally, you know, so you can have your server sitting somewhere in London, and someone in the United States having access to that.

133
00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:34.589
Godfried Williams: Provided that your organization, allows that, you know, and that is…

134
00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:45.170
Godfried Williams: dependent on the security policy of your organization, you know, or business, you know, that… are they going to allow that to, someone to…

135
00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:56.669
Godfried Williams: connect through VPN, Virtual Private Network, and, have remote access. You know, but when you shift away from just

136
00:19:56.910 --> 00:20:11.469
Godfried Williams: the technicality of the… of accessing the data. You can look at it from a wider perspective, where ordinary persons, customers trying to buy a product will sort of connect to clouds.

137
00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:25.780
Godfried Williams: and make an order, and that is seen on, let's say, Amazon platforms. You know, that's very common on Amazon platforms, you know, where you have the AWS and other, you know, databases that I use. So these are some sort of examples

138
00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:36.470
Godfried Williams: of cloud, enablists, I'll call them, database management systems, that allows, the concept of cloud to be effectively deployed. So, you look at the…

139
00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.970
Godfried Williams: Hierarchical database format,

140
00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:48.539
Godfried Williams: organized in a structure that enables the storage of live data set in a tree-like, you know, manner, you know, so…

141
00:20:48.540 --> 00:21:05.090
Godfried Williams: just… the way it's organized as well, it's hierarchical, the data structure allowing the data to be stored in that manner. You look at IBM Watson, Watson as an example, that provides a sort of cloud framework for data accessibility.

142
00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:08.950
Godfried Williams: As well as modeling additional functions designed to…

143
00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:25.840
Godfried Williams: enable the management of the big data remotely, you know. So, these are some examples, that exist in terms of, different type of formats. You look at Hadoop as well. That is also a way of organizing the…

144
00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:42.040
Godfried Williams: what they call the data, and allowing complex data to be managed remotely by users. You know, so the cloud provides a very effective backbone when it comes to data management,

145
00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:56.690
Godfried Williams: By businesses or organizations. And that is something that we need to always take into account when we are formatting the data, or when we're looking at how data is being formatted, because we need to realize that

146
00:21:56.850 --> 00:21:57.960
Godfried Williams: data…

147
00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:15.709
Godfried Williams: formatting, or the way data is formatted, has a kind of relationship with the way the data is stored, or the way the data can be stored. And as an analyst, or a manager, or head of department, you must have that

148
00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:20.399
Godfried Williams: Overriding understanding of the nature of your data.

149
00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:32.250
Godfried Williams: how the data was collected, which formats the data were also collected, and how they can be stored. Because if you don't have the kind of resources that allows you to support

150
00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:51.540
Godfried Williams: the data format, what it means is that you have issues with your data storage, and in terms of performance, in terms of effectiveness of data retrieval, for what kind of… what sort of purposes that you have within your business or within your organization.

151
00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:58.339
Godfried Williams: There are certain concepts that, we have to…

152
00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:04.479
Godfried Williams: understand, or try to understand, maybe research further. And these are programming

153
00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:13.259
Godfried Williams: components and concepts. Because we need to look at… going back to the subject, let's go back a little further.

154
00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:26.190
Godfried Williams: We need to look at data as an asset. So, data as an asset. Data is being acquired from different sources through investigative processes.

155
00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:32.400
Godfried Williams: And we think about the credibility of how the data has been,

156
00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:45.159
Godfried Williams: extracted from these credible sources. We've done our fact-finding and checking, and all the data pipeline processes has also been implemented.

157
00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:54.549
Godfried Williams: and taking into account how long we can store the data. And then, of course, we come to the data storage strategy.

158
00:23:54.580 --> 00:24:02.899
Godfried Williams: strategies that exist, and one of them is cloud storage. But what is also very important is looking at the architectural

159
00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:06.680
Godfried Williams: Nature of data…

160
00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:16.689
Godfried Williams: not just storage, but deployment, and how we manipulate the data within the business or within the organization. So.

161
00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:26.070
Godfried Williams: It doesn't sort of make us really think about the data in terms of only the sources and only the story, but also think about the data

162
00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:42.010
Godfried Williams: from a manipulation point of view. So how do you manipulate the data? How do we move the data from one source to another source? How do you move the data from one storage to another storage? And that's why this programming concept comes in.

163
00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:49.780
Godfried Williams: It's not required of any of you to be able to implement them, but it's important to…

164
00:24:50.060 --> 00:25:05.029
Godfried Williams: understand the way these concepts work. So, one of them is web scraping, the process of collecting and passing raw data from a website. So, what is a website? A website… a website is a client

165
00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:06.870
Godfried Williams: Program, you know?

166
00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:15.139
Godfried Williams: It's a client program, because you look at the… the architectural framework, or nature, of

167
00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:21.830
Godfried Williams: a web-based system. You have a website, Which is a Klein program.

168
00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:41.499
Godfried Williams: that interact with, or may interact with the database. So, that is what we call one tier, or in some part of the literature, can be described as two-tier. So, I'll go for one tier, because that's the interface is one tier. That is the client, the web page, and then the database. So, you do…

169
00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:48.510
Godfried Williams: one direct connection between your client and your database, and that is also enabled

170
00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:53.349
Godfried Williams: using some sort of middleware, and I'll come to that as part of the discussion.

171
00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:56.719
Godfried Williams: You know, so the web scraping idea is that

172
00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:01.160
Godfried Williams: We have data on the website, which is a client, but then…

173
00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:15.700
Godfried Williams: In some instances, you may want to analyze the data on your website. You know, for example, within the medical environment or the health sector, you like to know how many people visited your website.

174
00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:22.290
Godfried Williams: How many people are clicking on particular buttons on the website? What's sort of, where…

175
00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:40.670
Godfried Williams: these persons or entities are located, and when I use entities, because I'm not referring to other persons. You can have a program that can be interacting with your website, so you need to bear that in mind as well. So, you want to have a sort of program that is able to

176
00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:44.900
Godfried Williams: Script the content, on the surface.

177
00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:58.080
Godfried Williams: of your website, and that could be a crawler or a scraper. And by doing that, it sort of scrapes the test data, it could be not just tests, it could be sound, it could be image.

178
00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:05.989
Godfried Williams: and then co-port that data into a different story for further analysis. So that's the role of the web scraper.

179
00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:12.899
Godfried Williams: Then you come to pause and deposit. Do you have any questions due to the web scraping?

180
00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:26.359
Godfried Williams: Right, okay. So, so the parser and parser a parser analyzes a string of tests using, you know, lexical analyzer to determine whether

181
00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:36.769
Godfried Williams: The test confirms grammatical or syntax structure of the source language. Now, this is a very interesting aspect, because this forms the foundation of natural language

182
00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:47.689
Godfried Williams: processing. So they saw my talk about… I mean, everybody talking about AI, but they're talking about AI from a language perspective. You know, that is 67%

183
00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:57.479
Godfried Williams: of artificial intelligence, in terms of the subject matter, right? So, when it comes to the sort of AI that has been rolled out from

184
00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:09.869
Godfried Williams: DeepSeek, and all this, ChatGBT, and all that. These are artificial intelligence constructed modeling around natural language processing using

185
00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:18.729
Godfried Williams: large language models. So that's not the subject matter of this evening, but it's just a way for us to appreciate the role of the parser.

186
00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:36.809
Godfried Williams: and what Parzel does. You know, so the parser helps us to analyze the logical structure, which is the grammatical structure of whatever test that, you know, we have. You know what I mean, it could be in any kind of language as well. You know, so for us, you have

187
00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:56.049
Godfried Williams: the right kind of framework, you're able to do that. The parser tree is what, you know, organizes how the parser works in terms of, you know, manipulating the string of data being transmitted in an organized format, within that particular framework.

188
00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:59.910
Godfried Williams: Then, of course, I mentioned the web.

189
00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:08.710
Godfried Williams: scraping, you know, where now we can relate that to the web page, or the client program, where this is the calling or request program. So…

190
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:21.929
Godfried Williams: What a web page does is that when you go, when you type in a web address, what you're doing is that you are making a request through that web page, or through whatever search engine.

191
00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:36.110
Godfried Williams: But that is through the web page you're interacting through a client. So the web page will call, will make a request of where a document is stored. So you say maybe www.

192
00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:44.770
Godfried Williams: University of Essex online, you know, .uk, just as an example. And…

193
00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:51.530
Godfried Williams: That set of domain name will pass that reference, through the, …

194
00:29:52.000 --> 00:30:11.439
Godfried Williams: Universal Resource Locator, and then connect to where the document is stored, on a server. And that server could be anywhere, right? So, the web page plays a role of a client, it's a request program, it's a calling program, and that's something that we need to appreciate its role.

195
00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:27.330
Godfried Williams: Because by doing that, we understand how data is manipulated, or how the data is shared across different parts of any particular technology… technological framework. You know, so you only… you don't only look at the data from

196
00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:46.769
Godfried Williams: a database management point of view, or how data is stored, you know, so it's stored, you know, on an Oracle database, it's stored using SQL, it's stored using XML, or other formats, you know, and you don't only look at the data from that perspective, but you also look at the data

197
00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:58.729
Godfried Williams: Through the lens of manipulation of the data, the lens of how the data is shared across different parts of any infrastructure.

198
00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:08.389
Godfried Williams: So, then we look at the API. What's the role of the API? This application, programming interface, this enables inter-process communication.

199
00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:28.069
Godfried Williams: This comprises functions such as parsing, concurrent, or multiprocessing, data communication, interconnectivity. Why do we have all these facets when it comes to API? Because the application program interface is enabling different applications

200
00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:41.300
Godfried Williams: i.e, software to talk to each other, to be able to interact with each other. And this could be sharing data, this could be sharing processes, because, you know, there's something…

201
00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:56.430
Godfried Williams: in distributed processing at a low level called threaded. You know, when you want to sort of achieve high performance on systems, there's something called threading. You know, so you thread the process so that you can obtain high speed.

202
00:31:56.460 --> 00:32:10.750
Godfried Williams: You know, and the APIs all allows us to be able to sort of do that very effectively. And of course, then you have your middleware, there's the framework and application resource that enables a variety of

203
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:19.999
Godfried Williams: programming tools to interconnect. So… within your, should I say, all the resources you have on an infrastructure.

204
00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:31.979
Godfried Williams: Middle-wide is also very important, because, you know, different tools, programming tools, you'll be able to talk to one another, communicate with one another, share, programs.

205
00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:43.879
Godfried Williams: And because for that to happen, you need a sort of middleware that will play the role of a bridge between, let's say, an operating system, such as Windows.

206
00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:57.870
Godfried Williams: and Linux, or Unix, and allow them to be able to interact effectively. So, these are very important concepts that we need to understand. And as I mentioned, we don't have to

207
00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:05.489
Godfried Williams: be able to implement them, but we need to be able to understand their relevance on an infrastructure, you know.

208
00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:13.010
Godfried Williams: If you play the role of a data analyst, you know, a manager, head of department.

209
00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:28.110
Godfried Williams: any senior person or business analyst, you want to be able to understand the architectural landscape of your organization or your business, because that, in a way, positions you, strongly

210
00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:36.020
Godfried Williams: With respect to how things are done, how your organization interacts with different stakeholders.

211
00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:51.579
Godfried Williams: And also, I appreciate the security, you know, requirements that usually should be in place when you have these sort of things, being deployed, or these sort of resources being deployed, MSC. So, of course, I mentioned data storage, which we've already discussed that.

212
00:33:51.580 --> 00:34:02.750
Godfried Williams: in terms of storing data in different formats, there's examples, SQL, JSON, XML, and our examples of, of different,

213
00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:17.059
Godfried Williams: data storage formats. Then we have the IDE, Integrated Development Environment. So these are all resources that actually powers your infrastructure. You know, so IDE, you have, you know.

214
00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:24.540
Godfried Williams: platforms that enable you to, you know, construct or write codes, should I say, very…

215
00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:34.139
Godfried Williams: you know, microscripts, I'll call them, that allows you to perform routine tasks within the organization without necessarily

216
00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:46.609
Godfried Williams: contracting some external stakeholder to do that, you know, because sometimes you're dealing with very sensitive data, and because you're dealing with very sensitive data, you want to rely on your in-house

217
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:54.420
Godfried Williams: You know, personnel who, you know, might have gone through, all kind of checks, sometimes security clearance.

218
00:34:54.840 --> 00:35:04.000
Godfried Williams: Depending on the business or the organization, to be able to, you know, write certain codes to handle certain type of data.

219
00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:08.530
Godfried Williams: So, that is the IDE, in terms of the resources that

220
00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:15.530
Godfried Williams: are made available. So, any questions after this point, please? Any questions?

221
00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:17.030
Godfried Williams: Other comments?

222
00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:21.039
Godfried Williams: Any questions, comments you share?

223
00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:24.770
Sonya Jackson: No, I don't have any questions at the moment, thanks.

224
00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:33.919
Godfried Williams: Alright, thank you, Sonny. So, I think, these are the main points for this evening. This is an example script that I want you to play with.

225
00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:38.660
Godfried Williams: And if you have any challenges, just let me know. I can just run.

226
00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:43.910
Godfried Williams: One of the things I do, I have a, should I say recorded…

227
00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:56.159
Godfried Williams: you know, tutorial for this one. I'll just also share that, and then you can follow that if you're facing any kind of challenges, you know. So, this is the end of this evening's

228
00:35:56.440 --> 00:36:02.199
Godfried Williams: seminar. This script is just an example of.

229
00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:06.570
Godfried Williams: what do you call, interacting?

230
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:08.680
Godfried Williams: with different…

231
00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:25.610
Godfried Williams: making different requests on your platform where I use a resource such as Beautiful Soup to be able to do that, you know, in terms of how you… you can sort of manipulate the data from a website, you know, like this website, we have

232
00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:39.060
Godfried Williams: for this publication, you can manipulate the data from this website, you know. So here we have the data come from the Ebola virus disease, you know, from this website. You would extract that, and you would port it

233
00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:42.080
Godfried Williams: To a different table storage as well.

234
00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:59.909
Godfried Williams: You know, so I'll just urge you to, you know, play around with it. And also, we've also made available, the other data as well, that you can have access to through the platform, you know, that you can also manipulate the data and play with that data as well.

235
00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:03.459
Godfried Williams: what I'd like to do, I'll just end the seminar this evening.

236
00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:06.950
Godfried Williams: And, and hope to see you, the following…

237
00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:10.969
Godfried Williams: 7 as well. So, thank you for coming,

238
00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:12.840
Godfried Williams: And look forward to seeing you.

239
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:13.780
Godfried Williams: Right?

240
00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:16.690
Sonya Jackson: Thanks very much. Thank you, good night.

241
00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:18.249
Godfried Williams: Alright, good night. Thank you.

242
00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:19.340
Godfried Williams: Bye.
